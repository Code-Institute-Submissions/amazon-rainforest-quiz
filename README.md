# Amazon Rainforest Quiz

Based on the ideas from the Javascript project module, I have created a quiz as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development Course. It is a quiz about the Amazon Rainforest, a vast forest where most of that is situated in Brazil, where I was born and raised.
