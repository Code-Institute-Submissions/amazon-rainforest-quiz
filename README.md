# Amazon Rainforest Quiz

Based on the ideas from the Javascript project module, I have created a quiz as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development Course. It is a quiz about the Amazon Rainforest, a vast forest where most of that is situated in Brazil, where I was born and raised.

The design was created for *Desktop, Laptop, Tablet first* and *Responsive* but also works on mobile phones as shown below:

## Who is this quiz for?

This quiz contains questions about the Amazon Rainforest, which give players some knowledge about carbon emissions, area, species and other interesting facts about the Amazon Rainforest.

## What does this quiz do?

The quiz contains exciting questions and facts about the Amazon Rainforest. All the colors and design where thought in order to relate to natural environment. When the question is write, the option truns green and when wrong turns orange. The players can also track their performance by looking at the scores and feedback on the top right side.

## UX summary

My goals in building this simple and intuitive page where:

* Create fun interactive quiz for those interested in the Rainforest facts
* To make the quiz playable through use 5 questions
* Design the quiz aesthetically pleasing with simple and clear way
* To make the quiz responsive.

To achieve the goals above, I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### Features for future implementation

* The number of questions can be increased, and I can also implement the functionality of showing the rigth answer when the player doesn't get the correct one at first.
* Create sets of questions with increasing levels of difficulty. After this development, the game will be more exciting and variable for players.
* Create a feature where the players could save the results for comparing to other players.
